## Prepare Data

First, we import necessary libraries and load the dataset.

**Explanation:**
- pandas is imported for data manipulation and analysis.
- The Pokémon dataset is loaded from a CSV file into a DataFrame.

## Data Overview

We start by getting an initial overview of the dataset.

**Explanation:**
- The head function displays the first few rows to give a snapshot of the dataset.
- The info function provides a concise summary of the DataFrame, including the number of non-null entries and data types of each column.

## Data Cleaning

Here, we handle missing values and any inconsistencies in the dataset.

**Explanation:**
- The isnull function is used to check for missing values in each column.
- Depending on the analysis, missing values are handled appropriately, in this example, we drop rows with missing values using the dropna function.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

In this section, we perform various analyses to understand the distributions and relationships in the data.

**Explanation:**
- The describe function provides summary statistics for numerical columns, giving insights into the central tendency and dispersion.
- The value_counts function shows the distribution of primary Pokémon types, indicating the frequency of each type.

## Data Visualization

We visualize the data to better understand patterns and trends.

**Explanation:**
- matplotlib and seaborn libraries are used for plotting.
- A histogram with a KDE plot is created for the 'Attack' feature to visualize its distribution.
- A correlation heatmap is plotted to show relationships between numerical features, helping to identify potential multicollinearity and interesting patterns.

## Conclusion

In this project, we performed an initial analysis of the Pokémon dataset. We loaded the data, performed cleaning, explored various aspects through EDA, and visualized key features. This sets the stage for more detailed modeling and predictive analysis in future work.
